### **titanic-ml**

This project is a solution to a classification problem: to predict whether a Titanic passenger survived based on characteristics such as gender, age, ticket class, and others.

#### üöÄ technologies used

- **Python**
- **Libraries**
  - **scikit-learn**
  - **pandas**

#### üß† Goal

Learn to apply Ml algorithms to a practical problem, including:
- Data preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation

#### üèÜ Results

| Model                  | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|------------------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| LogisticRegression     | 0.94     | 0.91      | 0.93   | 0.92     |
| GradientBoosting       | 0.89     | 0.89      | 0.80   | 0.84     |
| RandomForest           | 0.86     | 0.81      | 0.80   | 0.81     |

The LogisticRegression model achieved the highest accuracy (94%) and balanced performance across all metrics.
